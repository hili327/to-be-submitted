                <p><strong>Mental health</strong> refers to a person’s emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how individuals think, feel, and behave, and plays a crucial role in how they handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Mental health is essential at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Just like physical health, mental health is a vital part of overall well-being, and maintaining it is important for living a fulfilling and balanced life.</p>

                <p>Having good mental health helps individuals realize their potential, cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to their community. Mental health is influenced by various factors, including genetics, environment, life experiences, and individual coping mechanisms. It can change over time, as people go through different challenges and experiences.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Key Aspects of Mental Health:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emotional well-being:</strong> The ability to manage emotions, cope with challenges, and form positive relationships with others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Psychological well-being:</strong> A sense of purpose in life, self-esteem, and a positive outlook on life, which help individuals feel good about themselves and their achievements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social well-being:</strong> The ability to build and maintain healthy relationships, communicate effectively, and engage with others in meaningful ways.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Mental health also influences how people respond to daily life events. A person with good mental health is able to manage stress in a healthy way, navigate challenges, and recover from setbacks. On the other hand, poor mental health can lead to difficulties in coping with life, hinder relationships, and affect productivity at work or school. Early identification and treatment of mental health conditions are crucial for improving overall quality of life and preventing long-term issues.</p>
                
                <p>Everyone’s mental health is unique, and it's important to recognize that mental health challenges are common and treatable. Mental health is not only about the absence of mental illness but also about the presence of positive qualities that enhance well-being and personal growth. Promoting mental health and well-being is a shared responsibility that involves individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole.</p>
